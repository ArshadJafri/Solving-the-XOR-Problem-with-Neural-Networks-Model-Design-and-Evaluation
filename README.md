# 🧠 XOR Classification with Neural Networks | 

This project explores solving the XOR problem using various neural network architectures, showcasing the power of non-linear modeling in supervised learning tasks.

## 🎯 Objective

To compare multiple neural network models (simple, complex, and benchmark) on their ability to solve the XOR problem using sigmoid activation and evaluate their training performance.

## 🧪 Models Implemented

- **Simple Sequential Model** (1 hidden layer)
- **Complex Model** (multiple layers, more hidden units)
- **Benchmark Model** (provided baseline)

## 🔍 Features

- Manual and programmatic training of neural networks using NumPy  
- Activation function: **Sigmoid**  
- Visualization of decision boundaries and accuracy trends  
- Saving and loading model weights via `.npz` files  

## 📁 Files Included

- `neuralnetwork.ipynb`: Full training and evaluation notebook  
- `*_model_weights.npz`: Saved weights for each model  
- `XOR_solved_*.npz`: XOR solution checkpoints and test states  

## 📊 Results

- **Complex model** solved XOR problem with higher accuracy and generalization  
- **Benchmark and simple models** showed varying performance based on architecture depth and learning configuration

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

- Learned the impact of depth and non-linearity in neural networks
